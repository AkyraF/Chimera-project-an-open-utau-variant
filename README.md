# OpenUtau

this is a personal project of mine that ive been wanting to do. 
basically my aim here is currently to add rvc support on here.
 why? cous i use it and i feel like it would be usefull to have it here instead of opening multiple programs at once. 
second goal is to add soundfont support for instrumental midid im thinging of merging that in from lmms afterthe first part is completed.
 i dont know how to code so ive been stumbling around using gpt but even i know thats not versatile enought to finish it off i odviously need to know what im doing for that.
 so im putting it here.
 maybe someone will become interested.
ill still try to finish it on my own but on the chance someone is up for it im open to receaving feed back and adding people into this.
 thats about it. 
id say i currently have a skeleton of what need to be dealt with...
